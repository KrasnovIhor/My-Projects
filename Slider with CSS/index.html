            <h2>The history of this iconic colorway traces back to a LeBron 2 PE that became one of LeBron’s most all-time coveted releases. Over the years, LeBron’s signature models have occasionally dropped with the characteristic black and lime green color combo. This LeBron 18 continues the tradition with a black-dominant upper speckled electric green to match the pop-color Max Air cushioning and outsole rubber. LeBron’s iconic logo shows upon the heel—the high-flying symbol of his unstoppable power and speed.</h2>
